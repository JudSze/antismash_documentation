# New features
##Major
<h4>ClusterCompare</h4>
ClusterCompare is a new algorithm for cluster comparison, taking into account
presence of biosynthetic profiles, NRPS/PKS module counts and layouts,
and gene functions along with the sequence identity and synteny used by the clusterblast module.

The range of scores for any pairing is between 0 and 1, with 1 being a
theoretical perfect score. When comparing multiple protoclusters against a single
region, the score may be higher and mousing over each protocluster's result will
show the 0-1 score for that particular protocluster.

ClusterCompare has been initially released with a comparison database for MIBiG 2.0
(`--cc-mibig`), but includes a script for easily generating custom databases
(which can be used with `--cc-custom`).

<h4>RREfinder</h4>
The precision mode of RREfinder was added and can be run with `--rre`. This will
detect and annotate RiPP Recognition Elements within RiPP protoclusters.

<h4>TIGRfam detection</h4>
Annotations based on the TGIRfam database can now added to a run (with `--tigrfam`).
These annotations will be present in the genbank output and
also be shown in the gene detail panel on the top right of the HTML output.


<h4>Annotation sideloading</h4>
A method of running antiSMASH analyses on genomic areas that antiSMASH does not
detect a cluster in is now possible via the use of sideloaded annotations. These
annotations, provided in a JSON format, can contain protoclusters and/or subregions
along with extra details to attach to those regions. One or more sideload external
annotation files with `--sideloader`.

<h4>Clusterfinder</h4>
The clusterfinder module has been removed due to being often [misinterpreted or
misleading](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30484124).

##Minor
<h4>Analysis:</h4>
* a number of additions and changes were made to detected RiPP protoclusters, see the glossary page for details
<h4>Output:</h4>
* JSON output now includes a simple representation of all detected areas
* output filenames can be customised with `--output-basename` instead of defaulting to the input name
<h4>Visualisation:</h4>
* Pfam domains for the region are shown in a detail tab similar to the existing NRPS/PKS domains
* Pfam domain hits for a single gene are now included in the gene detail panel of the HTML output
* added a button to download SVG images in the HTML output
<h4>Other:</h4>
* detection rules can now create and use aliases for groups of profiles

##Fixes and small changes
<h4>Input handling:</h4>
* improved error messages for invalid inputs
* improved handling of non-standard genbank inputs
<h4>Other:</h4>
* a workaround has been added for a MacOS specific issue using python 3.8+ with `--cpus` set higher than 1

Numerous other small changes and fixes were made internally, for a full list see the git shortlog.
